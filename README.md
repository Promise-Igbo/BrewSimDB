# BrewSimDB

This project builds a Web app that provides a user interface to query
a Beer Recipe database. 

This project utilizes MySQL, Node.js, Express, and Pug to render the HTML and JavaScript.

The application domain of the BrewSim Database provides information on beer brewing recipes. This includes what ingredients are needed, basic information on each ingredient, necessary instructions for someone who is familiar with homebrewing, and the ability to check if a recipe fits a certain style guideline as defined by the Brewers Association. The database application would be able to store information about beer recipes and output expected information about the beer brewed by the recipe, such as bitterness, alcohol content, and color.
